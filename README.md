You can read about nSPV approach [here](https://medium.com/@jameslee777/nspv-a-simple-approach-to-superlight-clients-leveraging-notarizations-75d7ef5a37a9)

nSPV [cli reference](https://medium.com/@jameslee777/nspv-reference-cli-client-cf1ffdc03631)

## Dev installation:

Python3 required for execution:

*  `sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip libgnutls28-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev python3-tk`

pip packages needed:

* `pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc fake-useragent ttkthemes`

## Starting:  

* Put wallet files to same folder with komodod or put komodod to the same folder with wallet (komodod should support nSPV)

* Specify chain ticker as cli arg on start. For now KMD and ILN supported: 
`python3 main.py KMD` or `python3 main.py ILN`

If daemon wasn't started - wallet will start it for you. If daemon was started as nSPV superlight client - wallet should start fine as well.

Otherwise you'll need to stop daemon first then start wallet.

## Disclosure
* Current build makes price requests to Coinpaprika by default every 5 minutes, when Refresh button is pressed, or fiat currency is changed. This will display your IP address to Coinpaprika during this request, if you would like, you can disable prices in the settings menu by simply clicking 'Disable/Enable prices' and renable it the same way. I am working on a solution to mask your IP address.
